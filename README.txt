
ALmoviesRenamer cares about automatically rename your movie files, searching for information on the web.

You will have video file names like this:

	A.Really.Cool.Movie.2008.ENG.XviD-Republic.CD1

renamed into this:

	A really cool movie (2008, A. Director, 90') CD1

Of course, you decide the rename pattern. 



How to use:

Once selected the movies you want to rename, 
the program will automatically search the web for information 
like movie titles, year, directors. 
Than you have to choose the renaming rules, 
and that's it!
