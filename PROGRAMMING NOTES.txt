The policy we use with PyQt is as follows:
• Use type str only when working with strictly 7-bit ASCII strings or with
raw 8-bit data, that is, with raw bytes.
• For strings that will be used only by PyQt functions, for example, strings
that are returned by one PyQt function only to be passed at some point to
another PyQt function—do not convert such strings. Simply keep them as
QStrings.
• In all other cases, use unicode strings, converting QStrings to unicode as
soon as possible. In other words, as soon as a QString has been returned
from a Qt function, always immediately convert it to type unicode.
This policy means that we avoid making incorrect assumptions about 8-bit
string encodings (because we use Unicode). It also ensures that the strings we
pass to Python functions have the methods that Python expects: QStrings have
different methods from str and unicode, so passing them to Python functions
can lead to errors. PyQt uses QString rather than unicode because when PyQt
was first created, Python’s Unicode support was nowhere near as good as it
is today.

le liste sono mutabili, quindi se ne faccio delle copie e cambio le copie,
anche l'originale cambia. per caso modifico copie di liste da qualche parte?

usare i set quando voglio liste con item non duplicati
